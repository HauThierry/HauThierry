# AI × Cybersecurity — Secure Multi-Agent Systems with Human-in-the-Loop

## 📌 Overview

This repository hosts a **research-driven, experimental project** at the intersection of  
**Artificial Intelligence**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Secure Multi-Agent Systems**.

The objective is to design, analyze, and prototype a **credible AI-based cyber defense system**
that goes beyond monolithic models by introducing:

- specialized AI agents,
- secure coordination mechanisms,
- explicit **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** decision-making,
- governance, auditability, and trust.

This project is **not a proof-of-concept gadget**.  
It is designed to be **scientifically rigorous**, **experimentally reproducible**, and
**operationally relevant**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The project aims to:

1. Study the current state of the art in **AI for cybersecurity**;
2. Identify **structural limitations** of monolithic AI approaches;
3. Propose a **secure multi-agent architecture** for cyber defense;
4. Integrate **human decision-making** as a first-class component;
5. Address **AI security, trust, and governance** issues;
6. Produce **experimental evidence**, technical artefacts, and academic publications.

## 🧠 Scientific Positioning

This work stands at the crossroads of:

- Machine Learning (supervised, unsupervised, hybrid),
- Intrusion Detection & Anomaly Detection,
- Decision Support Systems,
- Multi-Agent Systems,
- AI Safety & Security,
- Cyber Risk Governance.

The project explicitly addresses a **current blind spot**:
> *The security, robustness, and accountability of AI-based cyber defense systems themselves.*

## 🧩 Core Concept: Secure Multi-Agent Cyber Architecture

The system is structured around **specialized agents**, each with a clear responsibility:

| Agent | Role |
|------|-----|
| Detection Agent | Signal extraction, classification, anomaly detection |
| Analysis Agent | Correlation, context enrichment |
| Decision Agent | Risk evaluation, response proposal |
| Security Agent | AI threat modeling, attack surface analysis |
| Governance Agent | Logging, auditability, compliance |
| Human Operator | Final arbitration and accountability |

All interactions are:
- traceable,
- auditable,
- and designed with **fail-safe principles**.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

The project follows a **research-grade methodology**:

- Daily incremental work with public traceability;
- Reproducible experiments;
- Explicit assumptions and limitations;
- Critical analysis of failures and edge cases;
- Alignment between experiments, architecture, and publications.

- CIC-IDS (2017 / 2018)
- NSL-KDD
- Selected Kaggle cybersecurity datasets

All preprocessing steps are documented for reproducibility.

---

## 🔬 Experimental Scope

Experiments include (non-exhaustive):

- Supervised classification for intrusion detection;
- Unsupervised anomaly detection;
- Concept drift analysis;
- Human-in-the-Loop decision simulations;
- Evaluation of false positives and operational impact;
- Security analysis of ML pipelines.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Trust

Security is treated as a **first-class concern**, not an afterthought:

- Threat modeling of the AI system itself;
- Analysis of data poisoning, evasion, and model abuse;
- Trust boundaries between agents;
- Human oversight as a risk mitigation mechanism.

---

## 📄 Publications & Dissemination

This repository supports the production of:

- State-of-the-art survey papers;
- Methodological papers (HITL, governance);
- Experimental papers;
- Teaching materials and pedagogical notebooks.

Drafts and outlines are available in `08_publications/`.
